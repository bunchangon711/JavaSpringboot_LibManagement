# Digital Library Management System - Project Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for a Digital Library Management System using Spring Boot. The system will demonstrate OOP principles, system design knowledge, and RESTful API development skills.

## Core Features
1. **Book Inventory Management**
   - Add, search, update, and delete books
   - Track available copies

2. **User Management**
   - User registration and authentication
   - User roles (basic users and administrators)

3. **Borrowing System**
   - Check out books with due dates
   - Return books
   - Calculate fines for overdue books

4. **Reporting**
   - Most borrowed books
   - Overdue books
   - User activity

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup
- Create a Spring Boot project with required dependencies
- Configure the application properties
- Set up the database connection (using H2 for development)

### Step 2: Data Model Creation
- Define entity classes:
  - Book
  - User
  - Borrowing
- Create repositories for database operations

### Step 3: Business Logic Implementation
- Develop service layer for:
  - Book management
  - User management
  - Borrowing operations
  - Fine calculation

### Step 4: API Development
- Create RESTful controllers:
  - BookController
  - UserController
  - AuthController
  - BorrowingController
  - ReportController

### Step 5: Security Implementation
- Configure Spring Security
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Secure API endpoints

### Step 6: Testing
- Write unit tests for service layer
- Test API endpoints using Postman or similar tools
- Verify business rules and validation

### Step 7: Documentation and Finalization
- Document API endpoints
- Add README with setup instructions
- Review code quality and make improvements

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **3-Tier Architecture**:
  - Presentation Layer (Controllers)
  - Business Layer (Services)
  - Data Access Layer (Repositories)

### Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access
- **Service Layer Pattern**: For business logic
- **DTO Pattern**: For data transfer

### OOP Principles Demonstrated
- **Encapsulation**: Through proper use of private fields and public methods
- **Inheritance**: Through entity relationships
- **Polymorphism**: In service implementations
- **Abstraction**: Using interfaces for repositories and services

### Additional Features (If Time Permits)
- Email notifications for overdue books
- Book reservations
- Advanced reporting features
- Admin dashboard

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for services
- Integration tests for APIs
- End-to-end testing of critical workflows

## Learning Outcomes
- Spring Boot application development
- Working with JPA/Hibernate
- RESTful API design
- Security implementation
- Software architecture principles
