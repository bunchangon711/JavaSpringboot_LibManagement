CORS Issue Between Frontend and Backend when creating frontend
The error message you're seeing is a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy issue. When your React frontend (running on http://localhost:3000) tries to make requests to your Spring Boot backend (running on http://localhost:8080), the browser blocks these requests because the backend hasn't been configured to allow cross-origin requests.
